Author: Stan Schymanski, Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology

ESSM stands for Environmental Science using Symbolic Math (see http://essm.rtfd.io), which is a Python package facilitating the use of sympy for mathematical derivations and computations in environmental sciences.

For a notebook showcasing general features of ESSM, look at [api_documentation_master.ipynb](https://github.com/schymans/ESSM_jupyter_examples/blob/master/api_documentation_master.ipynb).
